# About Me
I am an undergraduate psychology major at Dartmouth College, with minors in computer science and philosophy. I work as a research assistant in Dr. Nicholas Jacobson’s [AI and Mental Health: Innovation in Technology-Guided Healthcare Lab](https://geiselmed.dartmouth.edu/jacobsonlab/) and Dr. Thalia Wheatley’s [Dartmouth Social Systems Lab](http://www.wheatlab.com). My goal is to pursue a PhD in clinical psychology, focusing on applying the precision medicine paradigm to clinical psychology. Outside of academics, I am an active member of the Dartmouth Sings a cappella group and serve as an officer for the Dartmouth Philosophy Society. In my leisure time, I enjoy reading, walking in nature, and computer and roleplaying games.

*!! I am applying to Clinical Psychology PhD programs for the 2025 admissions cycle !!*
