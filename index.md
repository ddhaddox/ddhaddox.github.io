# About Me
I am an undergraduate psychology major at Dartmouth College, with minors in computer science and philosophy. I work as a research assistant in Dr. Nicholas Jacobson’s AI and Mental Health: Innovation in Technology-Guided Healthcare Lab and Dr. Thalia Wheatley’s Dartmouth Social Systems Lab. My goal is to pursue a PhD in clinical psychology, focusing on applying the precision medicine model to clinical psychology and psychiatry. Outside of academics, I am an active member of the Dartmouth Sings a cappella group and serve as an officer for the Dartmouth Philosophy Society. In my leisure time, I enjoy reading, music, and computer and roleplaying games.
