## About Me

I am an incoming Clinical Psychology PhD student at the University of Arizona, where I work in Dr. Zach Cohen's [Personalized Treatment Lab](https://sites.arizona.edu/personalized-treatment-lab/). My research interests lie in using data science methods and intensive longitudinal data to improve the conceptualization, measurement, modeling, and prediction of psychopathology and treatment as idiographic and dynamical complex systems.
